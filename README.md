# Elixir Enum.reduce Accumulator Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Elixir's `Enum.reduce` function that can occur when the accumulator is not properly handled within the function's body.

## Bug Description

The provided Elixir code uses `Enum.reduce` to sum numbers in a list only if they are greater than 3.  However, if no numbers in the list satisfy this condition, the accumulator remains at its initial value (0 in this case), rather than throwing an error or returning an appropriate value.  This could lead to unexpected behavior in applications where the accumulator's value is vital.

## Solution

The issue is resolved by providing a more robust `Enum.reduce` implementation that handles cases where the condition is never met.  The improved solution returns a default value when no numbers greater than 3 are found.  This approach ensures predictable behavior and avoids unexpected results.
